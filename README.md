# Webcam Face Detection with OpenCV and Google Colab

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using a webcam in Google Colab. We utilize OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in both images and video streams captured from your computer's webcam.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies:

- OpenCV: For image and video processing.
- Numpy: For numerical operations.
- PIL (Pillow): For image processing.
- Javascript: To create the live video stream using the webcam.
- Google Colab: For running the code in a Colab environment.

You can easily install these dependencies in your Colab notebook or local Python environment.

## How to Use

To use this code for webcam face detection, follow these steps:

1. Import the required dependencies as mentioned in the code.
2. Run the code cells one by one in your Colab notebook.

## Webcam Images

- The code provides a function to capture images from your webcam.
- It captures an image and performs face detection using the Haar Cascade classifier.
- Detected faces are highlighted with bounding boxes.
- You can adjust the image quality and the filename for saving the captured image.

## Webcam Videos

- The code also supports real-time video streaming from your webcam.
- It overlays bounding boxes on detected faces in the video stream.
- The video stream is displayed in your Colab environment.
